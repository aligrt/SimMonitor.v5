The U-SIMonitor is an application for Android that performs AT-commands to the baseband modem of mobile phones. It can obtain the security credentials and sensitive information of the cellular technology, such as permanent and temporary identities, encryption keys, location of users, etc. Alternatively, it can be used to evaluate the security of mobile operators by analyzing how frequently the keys are refreshed or how often the termorary identities are updated. U-SIMonitor does not disrupt the normal operation of the phone while it is running.
